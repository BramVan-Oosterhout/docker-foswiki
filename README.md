docker-foswiki
---

# Why I created this dockerfile?
I've found no one create a new version of foswiki with docker, so I created one.
And I minized the size of docker with alpinelinux, the total size for this image is `144MB`.

# How to use
```bash
docker build -t michael34435/foswiki .
docker run -idt -p 80:80 michael34435/foswiki
```
